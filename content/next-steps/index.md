TL;DR: I'm joining [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). I'm sticking around in Portsmouth for a bit, but moving to London soonishâ„¢. Huge thanks to [Radweb](https://radweb.co.uk/) for the awesome 2 years there.

I'm super excited to say that I'm going to be starting at Overleaf in mid Feburary. I'll be working as a web developer on both the front- and back-end of their "Google Docs for scientists" product. It'll be a new challenge for me, especially learning Ruby/Rails and LaTeX (which the software is built on).

When I was little, I always imagined myself as a scientist and actually studied Biochemistry at university for a year. So I had a tiny bit of first-hand experience of the crappy tools that scientists use. Frankly it's amazing that they get anything done. Contrasted with the web, where almost by default learning materials and tools are free and open. I'm very happy to say that I'm now working to bring these two worlds together.

At least for the first couple of weeks/months, I'll be remote/commuting from Portsmouth. But I'm looking for a place in London (recommendations welcome for places nearish to the office in King's Cross). Hopefully I'll still manage to get back from time to time - at least to keep up our winning streak at [Pub Hack](http://www.pubhack.co.uk/)!

Which brings me onto all the awesome people at Radweb - and in particular my fellow [#DevsDoDesign-ers](http://devsdodesign.com/). They really have taught me everything I know about the web, so I wanted to finish up by saying a massive thank you to you guys.
