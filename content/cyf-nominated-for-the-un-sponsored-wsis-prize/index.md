As some of you may know, I've been volunteering with a charity called [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/) since 2018 (ish, I've actually forgotten when I started). Alongside our great team, I help refugees, asylum seekers and other disadvantaged people to become web developers. We've grown from one class in London up to over 200 active trainees across 6 different regions and we've had great success with graduates being hired into the industry in companies such as Slack, Capgemini, Thoughtworks, Deloitte, the BBC, AWS, and more.

We've maintained an open [curriculum](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/) since the start of CYF and developing this has been the focus of my volunteering "work" for the last few years. All of our material is [open source on Github](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum) with all the content in Markdown (and we welcome contributions!)

I'm excited to say that we've been recognised for our work and have been nominated for the WSIS Prizes 2024 under the "E-employment" category as part of the UN (yes, that UN!)

This is a public vote round, so I'd love it if you could take two minutes to vote for us! üíö You'll need to register an account [here](https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/stocktaking/Prizes/2024), then you'll find Code Your Future under section 7 E-employment of the voting form selector.

There's only 3 days left before it closes, so please go vote now! üó≥Ô∏è
